[Norfolk.js](http://www.norfolkjs.org/) turned one year old on November 7. With
nearly 200 members, great attendance to our monthly meetups, and world-class
speakers, I'm really proud of what we've built. Thank you to our members and
sponsors on our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/norfolkjs/) for sticking
around and keeping things real.
